## JADE BOARD ##

**What is this project?**

Jade board is a web-based application to use when you want to list up the tasks you are going to do. When you open the project you are automatically sent to the main site (index.html) as a built in text user (test) with a pre-made board where you can organize tasks and place them in different columns. To create your own user and boards, use the log out button to get to the login page. After creating an account and logging in to the app you will get the opportunity to create a new board. In the new board you can invite members to the board, create tasks, create new columns and set deadline and members to specific tasks. You will also get the possibility to create new users and as many boards and tasks as you'd like.

The web-site is responsive for both computers (tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge), tablets (Android/Chrome) and phones (Android/Chrome), and is fully possible to use for both blind, color-blind and death.
The user can use *TAB* and *ESC* to get to the different parts of the page, and move things around.
